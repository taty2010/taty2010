  Hello!!!
</h1>

My name is Tatyana, and I am a Frontend Developer with a unique blend of technical expertise and a creative background in art. I bring a strong eye for design and user experience to my development work, ensuring that the applications I build are not only functional but also visually engaging and intuitive.

In my previous role as a Software Engineer at Netlify, I was part of the Frameworks team, where I contributed to building and optimizing tools that empower developers to create seamless web experiences. While I enjoyed the challenges of that role, I am now eager to pivot back to a more frontend-focused position where I can fully leverage my skills in crafting beautiful, responsive, and user-centric interfaces.
